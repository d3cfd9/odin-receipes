        <li>Stir in half the cheese. Microwave until melted and well-blended.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a prepared baking dish. Top with fried onions and remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the onions are brown.</li>

  <p>Believe it or not, you'll need just four ingredients to make this classic green bean casserole:
    <ul>
      <li>Green beans: This easy green bean casserole starts with two drained cans of green beans.</li>
      <li>Canned soup: A can of condensed cream of mushroom soup creates a creamy texture and adds savory flavor.</li>
      <li>Cheese: This recipe calls for shredded Cheddar cheese. Use sharp, mild, or a blend of both.</li>
      <li>French-fried onions: The green bean casserole gets its crunch from a French-fried onion topping.</li>
      <li>Optional ingredients: Crumbled bacon, sautéed mushrooms or onions, garlic, Parmesan cheese, black pepper</li>
    </ul>
